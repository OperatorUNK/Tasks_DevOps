Troubleshoot Issue With Pods

There is a pod named webserver, the container under it named as nginx-container and it is using image nginx:latest
There is a sidecar container as well named sidecar-container which is using ubuntu:latest image.
Look into the issue and fix it, make sure pod is in running state before clicking the Finish button.
Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

1. At first  kubectl  utility configure and working from jump server, run below commands 
kubectl get pods 

2. To identify the error run below command  
kubectl describe pod webserver 

We can see that the image value is miss-configured, as it sais latests instead of latest
