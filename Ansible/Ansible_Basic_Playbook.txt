Ansible Basic Playbook 
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members was working on to test an Ansible playbook on jump host. However, he was only able to create the inventory, and due to other priorities that came in he must work on other tasks. Please pick up this task from where he left off and complete it. Below are more details about the task:
The inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory seems to be having some issues; please fix them. The playbook needs to be run on App Server 2 in Stratos DC, so inventory file needs to be updated accordingly.
Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add a task to create an empty file /tmp/file.txt on App Server 3.
Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

1. Fix the inventory file and add the app server as per your task 
thor@jump_host /$ vi /home/thor/ansible/inventory                      
thor@jump_host /$ cat /home/thor/ansible/inventory
stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_user=tony ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@

2. Create a Playbook file
vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml   
cat /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml
- name: Create file in appserver
  hosts: stapp03
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Create the file
      file:
        path: /tmp/file.txt
        state: touch

3.  Post file saved, run below command to execute the playbook 
ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory 
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml 
ansible all -a "ls -ltr /tmp/" -i inventory 

4.  Click on Finish & Confirm to complete the task successfully
