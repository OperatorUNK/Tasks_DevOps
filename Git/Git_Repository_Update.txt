Git Repository Update
The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repo /opt/demo.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.
